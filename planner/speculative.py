"""RFC-0034 speculative actuation — next-command predictor (brain side).

The kernel can act on a predicted next command ahead of the confirmed one
(gated by the Fase-1 safety envelope + SPECULATIVE_ACTUATION, default off). The
prediction source is REAL, not invented: when executing a committed skill plan
(or a deterministic scripted mode), the next command is already known — we just
translate the next plan step through the same policy and attach a confidence.

This module is a pure function (no I/O) so it is unit-testable; the SkillRunner
wires it to the wire via `send_predict`.
