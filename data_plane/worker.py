"""Data-plane ownership checker and pipeline gate.

Responsibilities:
  1. Given a ``robot_id`` extracted from the first STATUS or SENSOR packet,
     determine whether this data-plane node is the owner.
  2. In single-process mode: ask the injected ``ShardCoordinator`` directly.
  3. In multi-process mode: make a lightweight HTTP POST to the control-plane
     ``/v1/robots/{id}/route`` endpoint and compare the returned
     ``data_plane`` field against our own ``self_node`` address.
  4. If not owner → reject the connection (return False from ``check_ownership``).
  5. If owner → the caller (DataPlaneServer) can proceed with the full
     perception / planner / policy pipeline.

The actual pipeline invocation is intentionally NOT done inside this module.
``DataPlaneServer.main`` imports perception/planner/policy lazily so that
the module-level import of ``data_plane.worker`` does not trigger LM Studio
connections in tests.
